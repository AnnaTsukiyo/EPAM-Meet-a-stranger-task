# Meet a stranger

The program asks for an input string and prints the message in the "Hello, *input string*" format.

To complete the task, you need to go to the class [MeetAStranger](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/meetastranger/MeetAStranger.java). 
The program should receive a string read from System.in as input and display a message "Hello, *input string*".

It is guaranteed that when entering a string consisting of several words, the entire string will be output.
